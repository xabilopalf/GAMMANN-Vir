# GAM-ANNstyle
The present document is part of a larger project that aims to analyze the temporal patterns of microorganisms, including viruses, in a 20-year time series. The project is divided into three main parts: (1) Anomaly analyses, (2) Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and (3) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This document focuses on the third part, which aims to predict the viral abundance time series through the use of ANNs. The document is structured as follows: 

  - (1) Anomaly analyses
  
  - (2) GAMs: Generalized Additive Models
  
  - (3) Machine Learning: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
  
  - (4) References.
